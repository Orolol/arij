It covers the full project lifecycle: ideation, specification, kanban-based planning, automated code generation via Claude Code CLI, real-time agent monitoring, and release management.\n\n## Stack\nNext.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, SQLite via better-sqlite3, Drizzle ORM, dnd-kit (kanban drag-and-drop), Claude Code CLI (child_process spawn), simple-git (worktrees/branches), mammoth (DOCX→MD), pdf-parse (PDF→MD), unified/remark/rehype (Markdown processing), nanoid (ID generation)\n\n## Architecture\nFull-stack Next.js 16 application with App Router. Frontend uses React 19 with shadcn/ui components and dnd-kit for the kanban board. Backend is Next.js API routes that interact with a local SQLite database via Drizzle ORM. Claude Code integration spawns the `claude` CLI as child processes (plan mode for brainstorming/spec generation, code mode for epic implementation). Git worktrees provide isolated branches per epic. File converters transform uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX) to Markdown for context injection. Real-time monitoring uses polling. All data is local-first with no cloud dependencies."
